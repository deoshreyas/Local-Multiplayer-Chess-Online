# Local-Multiplayer-Chess-Online

## :zap: About
This is a small project I made to simulate, at the **very basic level**, a live room for chess using Python Sockets, Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript (ChessboardJS and ChessJS). It is a simple Full-stack application that you can run on a development server to play chess!

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
Just clone the repository on your machine, and install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You can use a virtual environment for this. Then just run `main.py` and start playing!
